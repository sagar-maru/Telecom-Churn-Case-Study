# Telecom Churn Prediction

**Author**: [Sagar Maru](https://github.com/sagar-maru)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Business Overview

In the telecommunications industry, customer retention is a top priority due to the high level of competition among service providers. Customers have numerous options to choose from, and as a result, they are frequently switching between providers in search of better offers, enhanced services, and lower prices. This results in a critical issue known as **customer churn** — the rate at which customers leave a company.

To counteract churn, telecom companies need to invest in developing strategies that allow them to proactively retain their customers. It is more cost-effective for companies to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones, as acquiring a new customer can be 5-10 times more expensive than retaining an existing one. Understanding customer churn and predicting which customers are likely to churn can help telecom providers take corrective actions to improve customer retention, such as offering personalized deals, better customer support, and improving service quality.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Customer churn in the telecom sector is a significant challenge. Customers typically leave service providers for reasons like poor customer service, better offers from competitors, or dissatisfaction with prices or service quality. The problem is further exacerbated by the high rate of churn in the telecom industry, which typically ranges from 15% to 25% annually.

It’s crucial for telecom companies to predict churn early, allowing them to take proactive actions before a customer decides to leave. Predicting churn will enable operators to take personalized actions such as offering discounts, special plans, or improving service quality, which may ultimately reduce churn.

A customer’s decision to churn is typically not an instant process. It occurs over time, and customer behavior can be tracked through different phases of their lifecycle:

1. **The ‘Good’ Phase**: The customer is satisfied and their behavior is consistent with their usual engagement with the service provider.
2. **The ‘Action’ Phase**: The customer begins to show signs of dissatisfaction, such as receiving a better offer from a competitor or encountering poor service quality. This phase is crucial because corrective actions can still be taken to prevent churn.
3. **The ‘Churn’ Phase**: The customer has fully decided to leave the service provider. At this point, they are unlikely to be influenced by retention offers.

Understanding the customer lifecycle phases is key to predicting churn. By identifying high-risk customers during the ‘Action’ phase, telecom providers can take steps to retain them before they reach the churn phase.

### 1.3 Objective of the Project

This project’s primary objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn in the telecom industry. The key goals are:

1. **Churn Prediction**: Identify customers who are at risk of churning. By predicting churn, telecom companies can proactively intervene with retention strategies such as personalized offers or better customer support.
2. **Identification of Churn Predictors**: Discover which variables are strong predictors of churn. This includes understanding the factors that influence customer decisions, such as service quality, pricing, or customer engagement.
3. **Strategic Recommendations**: Based on the churn prediction results, recommend actionable strategies to reduce churn and improve retention. These strategies could include personalized discounts, better customer service, or exclusive offers for high-value customers.
4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Since telecom datasets often have many features, we use dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify the dataset while retaining the important information for churn prediction.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance not only by accuracy but also by other metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics help ensure the model aligns with business objectives, especially in cases where identifying high-risk churn customers is more important than identifying all non-churning customers.

### 1.4 Approach to Solve the Business Problem

The following methodology is used to solve the churn prediction problem:

#### Step 1: Data Understanding and Preparation
The first step is to understand the dataset and preprocess it for modeling. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming variables to a format suitable for machine learning models. 

#### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this step, we perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. We examine the relationships between different features and churn behavior, identify outliers, and visualize the data to understand patterns that may contribute to churn.

#### Step 3: Handling Missing Values & Data Splitting
We address missing data either through imputation techniques (filling missing values based on statistical measures) or removal of rows with missing values. Once the data is cleaned, we split it into training and testing sets, ensuring that the model can be evaluated on unseen data.

#### Step 4: Feature Engineering and Selection
Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing features to improve model performance. Feature selection helps in identifying the most relevant predictors of churn, while eliminating noisy or irrelevant features to reduce overfitting and improve the model’s efficiency.

#### Step 5: Model Training, Prediction, and Evaluation
We then train machine learning models on the prepared dataset. Multiple models may be tested (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to find the best performing one. After training, we evaluate the model on both training and testing datasets using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics help in selecting the model that best meets business objectives, such as identifying high-risk churn customers with high precision.

#### Step 6: Model Optimization and Tuning
Once a model is selected, we optimize its hyperparameters to further improve performance. Grid search or randomized search can be used to find the optimal hyperparameters for the model.

#### Step 7: Recommendations
Based on the predictive model, we provide actionable insights and strategies to the telecom company. These strategies might include personalized offers for high-risk churn customers, targeted marketing campaigns, and service quality improvements.

#### Step 8: Submission File
The final step is creating a submission file, formatted according to the provided specifications. This file typically includes an `id` column (customer ID) and a `churn_probability` column, which provides the predicted probability of a customer churning.

## 2. Objectives of the Project

This project aims to build machine learning models to predict customer churn. The model will serve the following objectives:

- **Predict High-Value Churn**: The model will predict whether a high-value customer is likely to churn in the near future. This will allow telecom providers to act proactively and reduce churn by offering personalized deals or other retention strategies.
- **Identify Churn Predictors**: By analyzing which features are most predictive of churn, the model can provide valuable insights into the reasons behind customer attrition. This can help the company identify areas for improvement.
- **Model Evaluation**: While accuracy is a primary evaluation metric, other metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score will also be considered. For example, in cases where it is crucial to catch as many churners as possible, precision and recall will be prioritized over overall accuracy.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Based on the churn predictions, actionable strategies will be proposed to reduce churn. This can involve pricing adjustments, targeted marketing efforts, or improvements in customer service.

## 4. Conclusion

Predicting customer churn in the telecom industry is essential for improving customer retention and reducing acquisition costs. This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be used to develop predictive models for churn. By understanding the factors that lead to churn, telecom companies can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and maintain a competitive edge in a highly saturated market.

By leveraging data-driven insights, telecom operators can implement targeted retention strategies that not only reduce churn but also enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty, leading to long-term business success.
